Heterogenous Catalysis
======
Heterogeneous catalysis is catalysis where the phase of catalysts differs from that of the reactants or products.[1] The process contrasts with homogeneous catalysis where the reactants, products and catalyst exist in the same phase. Phase distinguishes between not only solid, liquid, and gas components, but also immiscible mixtures (e.g. oil and water), or anywhere an interface is present.

Heterogeneous catalysis typically involves solid phase catalysts and gas phase reactants.[2] In this case, there is a cycle of molecular adsorption, reaction, and desorption occurring at the catalyst surface. Thermodynamics, mass transfer, and heat transfer influence the rate (kinetics) of reaction.
